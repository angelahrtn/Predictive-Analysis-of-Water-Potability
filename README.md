# Predictive-Analysis-of-Water-Potability
# Project Overview
This project, conducted as part of a group assignment for the Data Management and Organization course in the third semester, focuses on predicting water potability based on a dataset that includes various water quality indicators. The dataset, sourced from a public domain, is analyzed using Python and machine learning techniques to determine whether water is potable or not. The project applies various predictive models and evaluates their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and other metrics. While this project provides insightful results, further improvements can be made through extended modeling and feature engineering.

# Case Description
The primary goal of this project is to predict whether water is potable (safe for drinking) based on several water quality parameters, including:
- pH level
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic Carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity
Water potability is a crucial concern influenced by various chemical and physical properties. The project aims to analyze and model these relationships to predict whether the water is safe for consumption based on these indicators.

# Objectives
- Build predictive models to estimate water potability based on multiple - water quality indicators.
- Compare different machine learning models to determine the most accurate - and practical for water quality prediction.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Identify key water quality factors that influence potability in the dataset.
- Provide a comprehensive analysis of water quality and visualize the results.

# Project Steps and Features
1. Data Collection
- The dataset was sourced from a public domain and consists of several features relevant to water quality, providing over 3000 observations of different water samples.

2. Data Preparation
- Features such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, and others were processed. Missing values were handled, and the data was scaled and normalized to improve model performance.

3. Model Construction
- Multiple machine learning models were built and tested, including:
  - Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective classification model.
  - Random Forest: A more advanced tree-based ensemble method.
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM): A robust model for classification problems with high-dimensional data.
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based classifier.

4. Model Evaluation and Comparison
- The models were evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
- Cross-validation was used to validate the model's performance, and confusion matrices were generated to assess prediction results.

5. Results Interpretation
- The analysis revealed key water quality factors that contribute most to potability predictions, such as pH levels, chloramine concentration, and turbidity.
- Among the models tested, Random Forest provided the highest accuracy, while Logistic Regression showed promising results with simpler interpretability.

# Tools
The following tools were used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - NumPy: For numerical operations
  - Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models

# Challenges
- Data Imbalance: The dataset exhibited some imbalance between potable and non-potable water samples, which required handling during model training.
- Feature Scaling: Different features had different scales, making it necessary to normalize the data to ensure fair model training.
- Model Selection: Determining the best model required extensive testing and cross-validation to ensure reliable predictions.

# Conclusion
This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to predict water potability based on various water quality indicators. The models developed provide valuable insights into the factors influencing water safety, with pH levels, chloramines, and turbidity being the most significant predictors. Among the models tested, Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed well, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

Further improvements could include the exploration of more advanced models, better handling of missing data, and feature engineering to improve accuracy. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in real-world applications such as water quality analysis and potability prediction.
